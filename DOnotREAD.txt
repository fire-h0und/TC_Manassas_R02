Do you pray all yor whishes never come true?

The long lost super jump capable prototype jumpship Manassass had miss jumped and got lost for decades
Can this be it? Did we just stumbled over it right in front of our doorstep?
Can we afford the enemy gets hold of it? Or criminals? Can we risk it ever happen?
Get to the artifact and secure it for exploration ASAP soldier!
Enemy contacts closing the primary objective ETA 2 minutes!
Go go go go go go!
