#Terrain guide<br>
<br>
After you have your concept put togehter, make the landscape in blender.<br>
I used the A.N.T. landscape plugin - messed around until i got something resembling rolling hills.<br>
Make the camera be orthogonal and perfect exponent of two (2048x2048 pixles for instance).<br>
Make the therrain height mapped (see nodes of the material) and render it to a texture.<br>
save_as the texture for import in sandbox (it will be PNG).<br>
Conver the texture to BMP (easy) or PGM (ascii format better but tricky).<br>
Import the terain into sandbox2 editor and play with it until you have the proper size and height.<br>
see the very rudimentary converter.py3 made for tuning the height with python (examine the source).<br>
Try have fun :o}<br>
To get all the assets open the asset DB manager and add the libraries you map will depend on...<br>
<br>
Now that you have the barren contour of the terrain you can assign the material kinds and types.<br>
Define the angles and heights for the terrain to make painting the terrain easier,<br>
Paint the terrain.<br>
<br>
You now have the barren basic terrain on the map ready to receive game assets.<br>
