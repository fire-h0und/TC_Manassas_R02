#Inital Map layout

After picking up the idea and the theme, you need to sketch a layout of what happens and how the game will flow:<br>
Will it "roll off the tongue" or should it stutter - will there be a choke point or not?<br>
How many players will be present at any given time?<br>
How will asset type "X" get (or not!) to position "Y"?<br>
<br>
I'm most comfortable in blender - so i used it for doodling up the level mockup<br>
I will later on use it for reference as i go about setting it up in Sandbox2 as well - so it's smart to keep it handy at all times...<br>
<br>
As the map undergoes play test and regular use the layout might inevitably change to match and adhere to<br>
the taste of the players actually using it - orthewise it might fade into obscurity or worse yet oblivion!<br>
<br>
Keep the sources to remind you on the strating point and to teach you where you assumed things wrongly ;)<br>
